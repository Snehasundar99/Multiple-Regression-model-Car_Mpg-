# Data discription:
1.mpg -It provides details about the mileage per gallon performances of various cars.(Our Target variable)

2.cylinders -The number of cylinders in an engine directly influences its power output and fuel consumption *More Cylinders: Engines with more cylinders (e.g., V6, V8) tend to produce higher power and torque. However, they also consume more fuel. *Fewer Cylinders: Engines with fewer cylinders (e.g., inline-4, inline-3) are generally more fuel-efficient but may have lower power output.

3.displacement - Displacement refers to the total volume swept by all the pistons inside an engine’s cylinders during one complete cycle (intake, compression, power, and exhaust).

4.horsepower - It contributes to a car’s performance, it also affects fuel efficiency.

5.weight - Weight of the car.

6.acceleration- Accelerating too quickly without considering road conditions may lead to unnecessary braking and additional acceleration, affecting overall efficiency3.

7.model_year - YEAR of yhe model.

8.origin - Manufacturing place of the car.
